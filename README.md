# 📊 Smart Array Toolkit

A menu-driven C++ application that performs common array operations and sorting algorithms.

This project is part of my Data Structures and Algorithms learning journey.  
I am also learning **Git version control** while building and versioning this project.

## 🚀 Version 1.0 (CLI Release)

Current version: `v1.0`

A stable console-based toolkit with the following features:

### 🔹 Array Operations
- Check if array is sorted
- Find largest element
- Find second largest element
- Move zeroes to the end
- Left rotate by D places
- Right rotate by D places

### 🔹 Sorting Algorithms Implemented
